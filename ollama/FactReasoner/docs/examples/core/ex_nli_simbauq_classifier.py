# This example estimates NLI relation probabilities with SIMBA-UQ using a
# trained probabilistic *classifier* to score sample confidence (instead of the
# default data-free aggregation).
#
# First train and save a classifier with scripts/train_simbauq_nli.py, e.g.:
#
#   python scripts/train_simbauq_nli.py --stage all \
#     --nli-data /Users/radu/tmp/raw_nli/train_balanced.json --num-pairs 900 \
#     --backend ollama --similarity-metric rouge \
#     --samples artifacts/simbauq_nli_samples.jsonl \
#     --out artifacts/simbauq_nli_clf.joblib
#
# Then run this example, pointing --classifier-path at the saved .joblib. The
# temperature schedule / n-per-temp / similarity metric MUST match what the
# classifier was trained with (the extractor validates the feature dimension).
