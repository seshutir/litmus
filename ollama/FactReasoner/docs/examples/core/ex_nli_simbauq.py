# This is an example of estimating NLI relation probabilities with SIMBA-UQ.
#
# The default (logprobs) NLI method needs a backend that exposes token
# logprobs. Ollama does not, so on Ollama every NLI call degrades to a fixed
# neutral relation. The SIMBA-UQ method estimates the probability of the
# predicted label via self-consistency (sampling across temperatures and
# scoring by consensus) and works on any backend.
