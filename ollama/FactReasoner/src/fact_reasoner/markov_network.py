# Lightweight Markov network and UAI serialization.
#
# This module replaces the (heavy) pgmpy dependency with a minimal, dependency-free
# implementation covering exactly what FactReasoner needs: building a pairwise
# Markov network of discrete variables and serializing it to the UAI file format
# consumed by the Merlin inference engine.
#
# The UAI output is byte-compatible with what pgmpy's ``UAIWriter`` produced for
# the same network, so Merlin marginals are unchanged. In particular:
#
#   * Variables are indexed by ``sorted((cardinality, name))`` -- with uniform
#     binary cardinality this is lexicographic by variable name (e.g. ``a10``
#     sorts before ``a2``). The Merlin output indices are mapped back to variable
#     names using this exact ordering (see :meth:`MarkovNetwork.index_to_variable`).
#   * Factor tables are flattened row-major over the factor's variable order, i.e.
#     for a pairwise factor over ``[x, y]`` the value order is
#     ``(x=0,y=0), (x=0,y=1), (x=1,y=0), (x=1,y=1)``.

class MarkovNetwork:
    """A minimal pairwise Markov network of discrete random variables.

    Variables are identified by string name. Each variable carries a cardinality
    (number of states). Factors are stored in insertion order, each as a triple of
    (variables, cardinalities, values) where ``values`` is the row-major flattened
    table over the given variable order.

    Attributes:
        nodes (dict): Insertion-ordered mapping of variable name to cardinality.
            Membership tests (``"a0" in mn.nodes``) are supported.
        edges (list): List of ``(source, target)`` variable-name pairs added via
            :meth:`add_edge`.
        factors (list): List of ``(variables, cardinalities, values)`` triples in
            insertion order.
