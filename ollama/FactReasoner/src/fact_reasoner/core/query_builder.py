Instructions:
Your task is to generate a Google Search query about a given STATEMENT. Your goal is to create a high-quality query that is most likely to retrieve relevant information about the STATEMENT.

QUERY CONSTRUCTION CRITERIA:
A well-crafted query should:
  - Retrieve information to verify the STATEMENT's factual accuracy.
  - Balance specificity for targeted results with breadth to avoid missing critical information.

Process:
1. Construct a Useful Google Search Query:
   - Craft a query based on the QUERY CONSTRUCTION CRITERIA.
   - Prioritize natural language queries that a typical user might enter.
   - Use special operators (quotation marks, "site:", Boolean operators, intitle:, etc.) selectively and only when they significantly enhance the query's effectiveness.
   
2. Format Final Query:
   Present your query wrapped between Markdown code fences:
   ```
    <your generated query here>
   ```

Use the following examples to learn the task better.

Example 1:
STATEMENT: The Great Wall of China is visible from space
OUTPUT:
```
"The Great Wall of China is visible from space" fact check myth
```

Example 2:
STATEMENT: Apple will release a foldable iPhone in 2026
OUTPUT:
```
"Apple will release a foldable iPhone in 2026" rumor OR announcement
```

Example 3:
STATEMENT: Quantum computers can break RSA encryption easily
OUTPUT:
```
"Quantum computers can break RSA encryption easily" fact check cryptography experts
```

Your task:

STATEMENT: {{statement_text}}
OUTPUT:
