    All LCS scores read the same coherence MRF, so this calls

    of each, plus the shared per-atom diagnostics (read once).

        scorer: An :class:`LCSScorer` (real or dry-run monkeypatched).

        reified_prior: Bernoulli prior for the reified score.

        ``num_atoms``, ``num_below_prior``, ``avg_norm_entropy``, ``log_z``,
        ``log_z_max``, ``log_z_min`` (from the runs that compute them), and
